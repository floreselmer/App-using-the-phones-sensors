(Phone come with sesnors)


*Create an app that lists the available device sensors.
Run the app on a device and on the emulator to view sensors.
Create a second app that gets data from the light and proximity sensors, and displays that data.
Interact with the device and note the changes in sensor data.
Run the app in the emulator and learn about the emulator's virtual sensors.*
